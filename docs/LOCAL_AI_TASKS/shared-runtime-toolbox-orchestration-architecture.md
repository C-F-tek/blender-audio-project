# Shared Runtime Toolbox Orchestration Architecture

## Scope

This document records the IA-Carmine runtime-tool architecture after the GPU/NPU orchestration refactor.

The goal is to keep the system provider-agnostic while allowing multiple reasoning lanes to request and consume tool evidence through a single controlled execution path.

## Current target topology

```text
GPU -> tool_requests -> orchestrator -> broker -> report
NPU -> tool_requests -> orchestrator -> broker -> report

provider -> never direct executor
orchestrator -> control-plane / routing / scheduling
broker -> only controlled executor
runtime heap -> append-only blackboard / visibility mesh
report -> reinjected read-only evidence
```

## Roles

### Provider lanes

GPU and NPU lanes are requesters and consumers.

They may:

- read repository evidence and generated reports;
- produce recommendations;
- produce structured `tool_requests`;
- consume broker reports as read-only context;
- classify missing evidence and runtime failures.

They must not:

- execute shell commands directly;
- apply patches directly;
- write persistent SQLite memory without explicit controlled authorization;
- create GitHub PRs directly;
- run Blender runtime;
- bypass broker allowlists.

### Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the control-plane.

It is responsible for:

- launching GPU planning;
- launching NPU audits;
- collecting checkpoint reports;
- collecting GPU and NPU `tool_requests`;
- scheduling report-only tool execution;
- passing requests to the broker;
- reinjecting broker reports into later context;
- preserving non-blocking behavior for NPU audits;
- surfacing guardrail counters in final reports.

The orchestrator decides when a request is executed, but it does not implement the tools themselves.

### Broker

The broker is the only executor.

It is responsible for:

- validating request packets;
- enforcing the allowlist;
- executing only known report-only tools;
- blocking or reporting disallowed requests;
- writing JSON and Markdown reports;
- exposing guardrail counters.

The broker should remain deterministic, narrow, and low-policy. High-level scheduling belongs to the orchestrator.

### Runtime heap / blackboard

The runtime heap is the shared visibility layer for provider collaboration.

It is append-only evidence, not an executor:

- GPU1 can publish a bounded evidence/tool-context request for GPU0.
- GPU0 and the broker can publish broker result visibility.
- NPU can publish a non-blocking support signal back to GPU1.
- Telemetry can summarize events, lane edges and direct-execution violations.

The heap must never execute tools, apply patches or write source. Brokered tool reports remain the execution authority; the heap only records what each lane can see.

## Supported shared toolbox capabilities

The shared toolbox currently includes report-only capabilities such as:

- agent agnostic tool inventory;
- agent memory inventory;
- transient request context;
- runtime SQLite memory status/search under controlled modes;
- Python line-count inventory;
- Python syntax validation;
- validation report contract checks;
- GPU planner JSON contract smoke;
- code-interpreter report inventory;
- provider runtime heap live signals and telemetry.

Tool execution is always mediated by `Tools/ai/agent_runtime_tool_broker.py`.

## GPU path

### Standalone mode

The GPU supervised runner remains able to execute runtime tools directly through the broker for standalone workflows.

This compatibility mode is intentionally preserved because the supervised runner is still useful outside the full GPU/NPU orchestrator.

### Orchestrated mode

In orchestrated mode, the GPU runner should behave as a provider/requester:

1. The GPU planner receives evidence and toolbox context.
2. The GPU planner emits structured `tool_requests`.
3. The orchestrator collects the requests from GPU reports/checkpoints.
4. The orchestrator passes valid requests to the broker.
5. The broker executes allowlisted tools and writes reports.
6. The orchestrator reinjects the broker reports as read-only context.

The architectural preference is to keep this path symmetrical with the NPU path.

## NPU path

The NPU auditor is non-blocking and non-primary.

It may:

- read GPU checkpoints;
- read runtime toolbox context;
- classify provider states;
- produce audit reports;
- propose structured `tool_requests`.

The NPU must not execute tools directly. NPU tool requests are routed through the orchestrator and broker.

In full-toolbox peer exchange, NPU micro support is bounded separately from heavy NPU audit waits and remains non-blocking.

## Memory model

The memory model is split by scope:

- persistent memory: durable project rules, decisions and long-lived facts;
- operational memory: scratch/runtime context that can be regenerated or cleared;
- report artifacts: JSON/Markdown evidence under `output/**` or compact committed evidence under `docs/LOCAL_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE` when explicitly needed.

Persistent writes require explicit controlled authorization. Report-only reads/status checks are safe default operations.

## Guardrails

Permanent guardrails:

- no provider direct execution;
- no free shell from provider output;
- no patch application from provider output;
- no production deploy path;
- no Blender runtime in these validation lanes;
- no implicit persistent SQLite writes;
- no SQLite/database artifacts committed;
- no `output/**` artifacts committed except selected compact evidence when explicitly intended;
- line-count CSV evidence under `docs/LOCAL_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE` is a first-class compact evidence artifact when listed by workflow `evidence_to_commit`;
- NPU remains non-blocking and non-primary;
- broker remains the only executor.

## Smoke coverage

Key smoke coverage after the orchestration work:

```text
Tools/validation/run_orchestrator_gpu_runtime_tool_routing_smoke.py
Tools/validation/run_npu_runtime_tool_execution_smoke.py
Tools/validation/run_npu_tool_request_contract_smoke.py
Tools/validation/run_npu_runtime_tool_context_smoke.py
Tools/validation/run_provider_empty_response_diagnostics_smoke.py
Tools/validation/run_agent_runtime_tool_broker_smoke.py
```

Expected no-provider/report-only invariants:

```text
provider_execution_performed=False
patch_application_performed=False
sqlite_write_performed=False
persistent_memory_write_performed=False
*_runtime_tool_request_count >= 1 when testing request routing
*_runtime_tool_execution_count >= 1 when testing broker execution
*_runtime_tool_failed_count=0 for positive smoke cases
*_runtime_tool_blocked_count=0 for positive smoke cases
```

## Operational workflow

Recommended local sequence after major toolbox/orchestrator changes:

1. Run targeted smoke for the changed lane.
2. Run GPU runtime routing smoke.
3. Run NPU runtime execution smoke.
4. Run syntax validation.
5. Run full memory/tool regeneration workflow when the architecture changes materially.
6. Commit only code/docs and selected compact validation evidence when needed.
7. Do not commit `output/**`, SQLite files, or generated runtime databases.

## Design rule

The high-level design rule is:

```text
Providers ask.
Orchestrator decides.
Broker executes.
Reports become evidence.
```

This preserves agnosticism: new providers or future local AI workers can join the same loop by producing structured requests and consuming reports, without receiving direct execution authority.
